    Stone Mountain's history traces back to before the time of European settlement, with local burial
    mounds dating back hundreds of years built by the ancestors of the historical Muskogee Creek nation 
    who first met the settlers in the early colonial period.The Treaty of Indian Springs in 1821 opened 
    a large swath of Georgia for settlement by non-Native Americans on former Creek Indian land, including 
    present-day Stone Mountain Village. In 1822, the area that now makes up the city was made a part of the 
    newly formed DeKalb County.
