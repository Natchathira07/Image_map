    A garden is a planned space, usually outdoors, set aside for the cultivation, display, and enjoyment of plants and other forms of nature. The single
    feature identifying even the wildest wild garden is control. The garden can incorporate both natural and artificial materials.Gardens often have 
    design features including statuary, follies, pergolas, trellises, stumperies, dry creek beds, and water features such as fountains, ponds (with or
    without fish), waterfalls or creeks.
